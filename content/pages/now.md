## Where:
I live with my wife and our dog in Arlington, VA.

## Working On:
I'm a product manager at Amazon working on network infrastructure automation.

## Reading & Learning:
- This past year I subscribed to MIT Technology Review (the old-school print version), been enjoying [their podcasts](https://www.technologyreview.com/podcasts) too.
- [GoPractice.io](https://gopractice.io) - an online learning course for data-driven product management.

## Listening to:
- Podcast: [Below the Line](https://belowtheline.com) - casual but in-depth conversations with creators.
- Album: [The Bonny](https://open.spotify.com/album/6OujNhvGQhJfDfcKLKLe7Y) by Gerry Cinnamon

## For Fun:
- Recently got together with friends for cocktails and playing Family Feud online -- had a blast. Apparently this is what fun looks like in your 30's.
- Relived the early 2000's seeing Y'all Out Boy, Texas's premier emo cover band, Fantastic.
- Planning a trip to Scotland for some point this year.
