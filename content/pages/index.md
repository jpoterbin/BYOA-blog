    <h2>Me in 10 Seconds</h2>
    <p>I thoroughly enjoy leading ideas from back-of-the-napkin to valued services. You can read more about my <a href="projects.html">projects</a> I have worked on.</p>
    <p>My work relies on my strengths: taking full responsibility, thinking about the future, making sure each puzzle piece fits together, being empathetic and moving the day-to-day forward with organized collaboration.</p>
    <p>I strongly believe in the power of words, a good first impression and a pragmatic approach. I seek out ideas, people, and experiences that have a positive, lasting impact. I enjoy seeing multiple viewpoints to create something cohesive.</p>
