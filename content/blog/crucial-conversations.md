## ​Big Ideas:
- You know you're having a crucial conversation when the stakes are high, there's opposing opinions, and the potential for strong emotions.​​​
- You need a skillset for crucial conversation dialogue
- The conversation should first start out by creating a "Pool of Meaning" - where everyone feels safe to add their opinions, feelings, theories, and experiences. The Pool of Shared Meaning is a measure of the group's IQ. This is very similar to the Product Management concept of Shared Understanding when writing and grooming stories.
The quickest way back to a safe environment is establishing a Mutual Purpose -- that you're working toward a common outcome and you care about their goals, interests, values.
- There's no purpose to enter a conversation without a mutual purpose. And you can't stay in a conversation if you don't have mutual respect.
- You can have a dialog with anyone if you create a sense of kinship and connection, and honor and regard their basic humanity.
- To get a conversation back to safety: apologize, contrast, create mutual purpose. Apologize: Sincerely express sorrow for the feelings you caused.​ Contrast: A don't/do statement. The "don't" part addresses concerns that you don't respect them. The "do" part confirms your respect and clarifies purpose.


## Quotes:
- Culture runs downhill in an organization.
- Twenty years of research involving more than 100,000 people reveals that the key skill of effective leaders, teammates, parents, and loved ones is the capacity to skillfully address emotionally and politically risk issues. Period.
- When it comes to risk, controversial, and emotional conversations, skilled people find a way to get all relevant information out in the open. That's it.
- People skilled in crucial conversations present their brains with a more complex question. They routinely ask: "What do I want for myself, the other persons, and the relationship?"
- Emotions don't settle upon you like a fog. They are not foisted upon you by others. No matter how comfortable it might make you fell saying it -- others don't make you mad. You make you mad. You make you scared, annoyed, or insulted. You and only you create your own emotions.
- One of the best ways to persuade other is with your ears.
- To help turn your visceral tendency to respond in kind into genuine curiosity, look for opportunities to be curious. Do your best to get at that person's source of fear and anger.
- Don't allow people to assume dialogue is decision making. Dialogue is a process for getting all relevant meaning into a shared pool. That process involves everyone. However, this doesn't mean they are guaranteed to take part in the final decision.
