<h2>My Product Journey</h2>
<p>Growing up in the small town of Tonganoxie, Kansas, I spent my summers helping on my grandparents’ farm. These formative experiences taught me the value of hard work, resourcefulness, and problem-solving at a young age. The lessons I learned - from tending to the crops to troubleshooting equipment issues - would prove invaluable as I later discovered a passion for technology and creating digital experiences.</p>
<p>When my parents brought home our first Windows 95 Compaq computer, I was immediately captivated. Tinkering with that machine sparked a lifelong love for hands-on problem-solving with creative digital expression - from building HTML websites to producing videos. This diverse skillset naturally guided me to the University of Kansas, where I earned a degree in Journalism with a specialization in strategic communication.</p>
<p>My product management journey began at an Austin startup, where I wore multiple hats while helping raise $1.9M and shaping the product from the ground up. This experience taught me the importance of adaptability and building products that serve the needs of both the business and its customers. I then brought those lessons to The Home Depot, managing enterprise communications systems that reached millions of users. There, I also played a key role in launching critical initiatives like curbside pickup during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>As Senior Product Manager at Yonder, I established their first customer discovery program and implemented data-driven methodologies that improved core user experiences by 20%. This focus on customer-centricity and continuous improvement has been a hallmark of my work.</p>
<p>After a brief tenure at Walmart Global Tech leading their eSim iPhone purchasing journey, I joined Amazon’s Global Internet Infrastructure Engineering organization. There, I drove voice-of-customer initiatives across 40+ business units as a product manager before advancing to Technical Product Manager, where I now focus on data management challenges for network automation and security applications.</p>
